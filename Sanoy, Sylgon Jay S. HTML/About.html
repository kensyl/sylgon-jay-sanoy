					<h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site. </h1>
					<p> With over a decade of development experience in a number of inductries i realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too ofthen devlopers rarely communication to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in the final product that fails to reach to the goal sought by the customer and end user.
					</p>
					<p>For this reason i dedcided to utilize a completely different development pattern thet focuses on highly focused communication and trasparent design pattern. WHen i take on the a project not only do i work ro craft the application according to the clients specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with client`s goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.
